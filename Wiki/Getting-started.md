If you get an error during the download process or you have no Internet/WAN connection on the device, just manually download the GUI.tar.bz2 file and put in /tmp folder via SCP then execute the other (non curl) commands listed into [[Installation](https://github.com/Ansuel/tch-nginx-gui/wiki/Installation)].
